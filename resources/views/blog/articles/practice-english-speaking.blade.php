          <p style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; ">'I'll take my IELTS exam in 2 months. Oh my God! I need someone to help me on practicing my english speaking... but who? My friends or my parents don't speak english. My boyfriend doesn't speak a word in english. How to find a serious english speaking partner nowadays? '</p><br>

          <p style="text-align:justify;">Alissa* is a Biology student in her country and she wants to study at University of Iowa/USA. She is a good english listener, writer and reader. But on speaking she feels a lot unsecure. The band score she needs for her goals is 7. </p><br>

          <p style="text-align:justify;">There are a lot of students, workers, professionals in this situation. For the most of people, to band a good score on proficiency test or be able to have an effective communication skill can be the 'passport to have a new life' from now... or maybe it means... <br><br> <span style="font-style: italic;"> '...you have to wait a little more. You didn't go so well on the exam. '</span> </p><br>

          <p style="text-align:justify;">Frustration? <br><br> <span style="font-style: italic;">'Yep, but sometimes you have no choice. What about my dreams? My goals? I know that it is not easy, but you have to try again.'</span> <br><br> 
          	<p style="text-align:justify;">Like Alissa, if you find yourself in this moment on your life, let's talk about 3 tips to help you to overcome these issues.</p><br>

          <h2 class="section-heading">1. Use Online English Speaking Tests </h2><br>

          <p style="text-align:justify;">For the most of people that don’t have enough time and the schedule is ever growing, practice english conversation when going to school or going work, when cleaning the house, dressing your clothes or doing some normal daily activity can be time and money saving. </p><br>

          <p style="text-align:justify;">You don't need to read the questions on the screen and respond. You listen to the question (you can check the text on the screen if you wish) and you respond with your words. The system will record your answer to that specific question with timer. It can fits to the ones who have difficulties on finding an someone to talk and need the flexibility to practice anytime or anywhere they want. </p><br>

          <p style="text-align:justify;">English-Academics provides you an <a href="/./">online english speaking tests</a> for IELTS and TOEFL exams with more than 300 updated questions. You can either track your progress by listening to your own answers. </p><br>

          <!-- <p style="text-align:justify;">There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p> <br>
          <blockquote class="blockquote" style=" text-align: center;">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote> <br>

          <p style="text-align:justify;">Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p> <br> -->

          <h2 class="section-heading">2. Use Mobile Apps (Video Call)</h2><br>

          <p style="text-align:justify;">Apps like Cambly or iTalk that gives you the opportunity to speak in english with some teachers and native english speakers (main requirement for teachers).  </p><br>

          <p style="text-align:justify;">In some countries the service can be kinda expensive considering what they provide regarding to time of english speaking (15 min, 30 min or 1 hour per week, depending on the plan you buy), but it is a good alternative if you identify yourself with this learning model.  </p><br>

          <p style="text-align:justify;">These apps require a good internet connection if you don't want a choppy video or audio, slow sound, during your learning, right?  It is a good alternative for the ones who have enough time and the schedule is free.   </p><br>

          </center>
          <br><br>
          <h2 class="section-heading">3. Use Messenger Apps and Create Groups  </h2><br>

          <p style="text-align:justify;">A good alternative is to search for english speaking partners on Facebook groups. There are a lot of people there who need to practice english conversation and don't have someone to talk to. </p>
          <br>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">One of the challenges you can face is to find a person with good skills on english speaking to talk about anything (what happens on the tests). Some of them create groups on WhatsApp, Telegram or some messenger app to connect two or more people.  </p>

          <p style="text-align:justify;">This can be a good choice if you have difficulties on practice english speaking all by yourself and maybe depends on other person to improve your skills.  </p>
          <br><br>
          <h2 class="section-heading">Feeling Confortable</h2><br>

          <p style="text-align:justify;">To get fluency on any foreign language, one of the most important things that you need to consider is to feel confortable when practicing and learning.  </p><br>

          <a href="#">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="/./assets/images/blog/post-sample-image.jpg" alt="">
          </a>
          <center>
            <small class="caption text-muted">Find some comfortable place to study.</small> 
          </center>
            <br><br>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">A suggestion to improve your english learning is to find a comfortable place to stay and answer to questions setting up a time to respond them. In real life people will ask you something and if you want to have a good conversation, you probably don't want to last too long to answer a simple question, don't you? </p>
